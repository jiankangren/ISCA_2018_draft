This paper proposes REMARK, a \underline{R}eliable and \underline{E}fficient \underline{M}ultitask Recovery Fr\underline{A}mewo\underline{RK}, which realizes reliable and efficient TPC recovery.
REMARK provides an automatic and efficient peripheral recover hardware architecture supporting the system with multiple peripherals.
Moreover, a new checkpointing strategy for the multi-device system is also provided to avoid the inconsistency issues between different devices and incurs the lowest rollback overhead.
A REMARK-enabled NVP is fabricated and evaluated, which demonstrates that REMARK enables reliable data transmission with $13\times$ completeness improvements compared with state-of-the-art. 
In conclusion, REMARK implements a critical component that existing NVP solutions are missing and will greatly improve the applicability of TPCs in the IoT era.
